                    From SME to MNC, here’s what you need to know in the service of your stakeholders as you necessarily reinvent, 
                    or at least shed some skin in the ‘new now’ to emerge at the end of our COVID-19 pandemic more attuned to the world that we are creating, 
                    and better prepared to define your business future and its sustainability in that reality.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Over this series of business cases you will hear from subject experts and become equipped with better tools to succeed with, 
                    along with the know-how to use them creatively, skillfully and effectively.

                    Business Case 1.<br>
                    Unbundling Innovation, Understanding Adam
                  </h3>

                  <p>
                    Adam runs a successful janitorial services company in Toronto. The pandemic and new sanitization protocols have been great for Adam’s business, 
                    but at what cost, and can this new business growth become sustainable?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When I visited Adam’s plant a few weeks ago, he had four pallets of surface disinfectant on the loading dock waiting to be shipped to a commercial client, 
                    a shipping coordinator  who was home-officing, a third party delivery company running late, and a handful of new requests for lucrative sanitization cleaning services that Adam didn’t have available staff to assign new work to.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A tsunami of new ‘pandemic-related’ business has doubled Adam’s company revenue, maxed-out his service capacity, and has his cash-flow bouncing unpredictably. 
                    Frankly, Adam is worried that if this windfall of new business evaporates, he will not be able to return to his previous business model and he feels the pressure to reinvent.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Frustrated and confused over his dilemma Adam looked at me and said,<br>
                    “Dr. Gabe, maybe what I need is innovation.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    One thing is for sure, it is not just SMEs like Adam’s janitorial company that are feeling the insecurity that arises from the myriad and unprecedented business challenges of the new now. 
                    The fear that elevator occupancy restrictions to support ‘safe’ social distancing will become permanent have urban high-rise office building tenants seriously weighing the pros and cons of moving to suburban low-rise buildings that offer better accessibility. 
                    While the early success of extensive home-officing has managers pondering workspace requirements and redrafting their pre-COVID office footprint, operations people are rethinking IT and supply chain networks, and both are working together to prototype connected collaboration and productivity solutions.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    While many companies could not see beyond their current business model and negative cash flow and have now gone out of business, 
                    and others simply saw an opportunity to shut down unprofitable divisions, there are those companies whose DNA is all about being resilient and adaptive, 
                    to seeks solutions that some call ‘innovation’, and yes, make mistakes along the way.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So, what is innovation and why do we have to unbundle it?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For starters, when asked to define innovation, even business leaders have difficulties agreeing on a common definition, 
                    or when they use the word innovation and are asked why, they seldom connect innovation with a direction, 
                    positive change or measurable outcome. On the contrary, innovation is often paired with further descriptive words that include breakthrough, disruptive, game-changing, or quantum leap.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In ‘The Hard Truth About Innovative Cultures”, Gary P. Pisano, Harry E. Figgie Jr. Professor of Business Administration and the Senior Associate Dean of Faculty Development at Harvard Business School examined the realities of innovative company cultures and stated, 
                    “Innovative company cultures are not all fun and games.” Professor Pisano went on to say that innovative companies are paradoxical and uses the following contradictions to illustrate his point,

                    <ol>
                      <li>Tolerance for Failure but No Tolerance for Incompetence.</li>
                      <li>Willingness to Experiment but Highly Disciplined and High Levels of Expectation.</li>
                      <li>Psychologically Safe but Brutally Candid.</li>
                      <li>Collaboration but with Individual Accountability.</li>
                      <li>Flat, Low Hierarchy but Strong Leadership.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Knowing this, when it comes to the job of making innovation happen, truly innovative companies must proactively and productively balance inspiration and rigor. 
                    While we tend to ignore or downplay the uncomfortable aspects related to innovation, innovation expert Nick Skillicorn draws attention to the most common challenges when innovating. He observed that,
                  </p>

                  <h3>1. It’s all about ‘creating’ (the doing) not about being ‘creative’</h3>

                  <p>
                    ‘Organizations usually start with all kinds of creative endeavors, such as ideation workshops, hackathons, and idea challenges. Typically, people really enjoy these sessions and feel inspired by them. 
                    It’s also quite likely that some good ideas that the organization could really benefit from will come up. However, that is unfortunately where it often ends. 
                    There are usually a number of practical reasons for that unfortunate result, such as limited time or resources for progressing the ideas.’
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In his Inc.com article Nick goes on to say that “making innovation happen typically requires a diverse set of multidisciplinary skills ranging from the soft, such as empathy and design, 
                    to some of the harder ones such as sales and engineering.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The exact set of skills obviously depends on the innovation in question, but the key is having all of them within the core team, and in the correct proportion to what you’re trying to achieve.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    There’s an endless number of people who consider themselves as “creative”, meaning that they’re capable of coming up with ideas, but far fewer who can actually “create” and make those ideas happen.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    It’s important to realize that unless they get properly executed, ideas are worthless.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    An idea is just a starting point. What’s more, whenever you come up with an idea, there have usually been hundreds or thousands of people with the same exact idea. They’ve just done nothing about it – or have failed and eventually quit.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As a rule of thumb, most creators are also creative, but the reverse simply isn’t true.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So, make sure your team consists of “creators”, not “creatives”.
                  </p>

                  <h3>2. Psychologically, it’s incredibly tough</h3>

                  <p>
                    Innovators fail far more than they succeed. Even the ones who eventually do succeed have failed numerous times in the process.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Probably the most famous example of this is the thousands of attempts it apparently took Edison to get the lightbulb right.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Your work will often be criticized from many directions, and usually for good reason. With very few exceptions, it always takes multiple iterations for anything new to become great. To get there, you’ll have to learn to absorb all of that negative feedback, be motivated by it, and learn from it.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    You also need to be brutally honest with yourself about the quality of your work. Set the bar higher for yourself than anyone else would, and you’ll be much better equipped to deal with the challenges you’ll inevitably face.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As mentioned, the most innovative companies never accept incompetence or substandard work, which can obviously make these organizations quite demanding places to work at.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Still, even while being completely aware of the brutally challenging realities, you need to keep believing in yourself, and your work, without becoming delusional.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The prolonged periods of high stress, constant failure and a steady stream of critique on a daily basis is certainly something most people aren’t ready or well-equipped for. Innovators need to be mentally tough to make it through these inevitable hardships.
                  </p>

                  <h3>3. It’s often not very glamorous work</h3>

                  <p>
                    Innovations don’t just happen. As mentioned, there’s always plenty of hard work involved. What’s more, most of that work isn’t likely to be the cool creative stuff that people think about when it comes to innovation: the ideation, the planning, the design, or even creating the first version of something new.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    These are obviously all essential to get it right, but most of the time you’ll spend working on the innovation will actually be spent on much more mundane things.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Yet when it comes time to have a serious discussion about how to actually be innovative, too often CEOs, managers and staff find themselves unable to articulate or agree on what they mean. Some people may focus on talking about new technology, others on branding and another group is adamant that the focus should be on breakthrough ideas and "moonshots".
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    With more than 50,000+ searches on Google each month for the two terms, ‘What is Innovation?’, and ‘Innovation definition’, so it is clear that there are thousands of other business people out there who also can't agree on what it means.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    "Innovation" it seems has become a buzzword that everyone interprets in their own way, similar to other vague business-speak like "quality" and "efficiency".”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Nick interviewed fifteen of the world’s most innovation experts and asked them "What is your definition of innovation?" He noted that, “Initially, 
                    it appears like even the experts can't agree on what innovation actually means. But when you analyze what they are saying, 
                    you can begin to spot common threads that come up again and again. After looking through all the responses, 
                    there is evidence that there are 9 common aspects which are most important when talking about innovation. Some are cited by more experts than others, 
                    and therefore should carry more weight when you are discussing innovation.”
                  </p>

                  <h3>“The nine most important aspects of an innovation definition (in order of decreasing importance that they cite are):</h3>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Having an idea: Coming up with something fundamentally new and original is vital to differentiate your business' offering.</li>
                    <li>Executing the idea: Just as important as coming up with an idea is actually making it become a reality. It is no use brainstorming 700+ ideas if none of them ever become more than a sticky note.</li>
                    <li>Addresses a real challenge: Innovations need to provide a solution to an actual market need (even if customers don't realize they have the need yet). Too many companies come up with solutions to problems that don't exist, and then struggle to understand why nobody is buying them.</li>
                    <li>Adds value to the company: The company needs to benefit from the innovation for it to be viable and considered a success. Usually this means that the innovation makes a profit and helps the company grow revenue, although it can also add value in other ways, such as being responsible for improving the appeal of other products, the brand, or opening up a new customer market.</li>
                    <li>Add value to the customer: The customer must also perceive that the innovation has enough value to be worth their while. This trait is often overlooked as companies interpret value from their own perspective (such as focusing on benefits and new features), whereas customers will assess value based on their own desires, experiences and comparisons to all competitors in the market.</li>
                    <li>Different perspectives and thinking: Several experts highlighted the fact that innovative thinking requires a different approach to what has worked historically. It doesn't always need to be radical, but it should help evolve the way that companies think and approach challenges</li>
                    <li>Moving forward: Companies which try to keep doing the same thing forever will eventually be outmaneuvered by a competitor who is willing to try something different. Innovations should help the company adapt to the changing marketplace, and ideally become a leader.outmanoeuvred by a competitor who is willing to try something different. Innovations should help the company adapt to the changing marketplace, and ideally become a leader.</li>
                    <li>Definition not important: Several experts believe that a unified definition is not important, as it may vary between companies.</li>
                    <li>Addressing new markets: Innovations should help the company access either new customer segments, or customers in new territories.”</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h3>To summarize the experts polled, innovation is all about,</h3>

                  <p class="text-center expertOps my-5 px-3">
                    <em>Having an idea (60%)</em><br>
                    <em>Executing the idea (60%)</em><br>
                    <em>Addressing a real challenge (40%)</em><br>
                    <em>Adding value to the company (40%)</em><br>
                    <em>Adding value to customer (40%)</em><br>

                    <em>Definition is not important (13%)</em><br>
                    <em>Addressing a new market (7%)</em>
                  </p>

                  <p>All factors combined, if we were to create an ultimate innovation definition of innovation, it could be:</p>

                  <p>
                    <em>“Executing an idea which addresses a specific challenge and achieves value for both the customer and the company.”</em>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Circling back to Adam and his ‘need for innovation’, we sat on the edge of his loading dock, enumerated the unbundled aspects of innovation and a possible definition, and figured out that he didn’t have to reinvent the wheel, 
                    just make it better. Where Adam is experiencing an operational bottleneck, we looked to science for a solution and found it, 
                    to offer a service that renders any surface free from pathogens for up to 90 days and in the process creates uncontested market space for Adam’s business, 
                    but that is a different case.
